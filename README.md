# HandWritten_Digits_Recognizer
This is the final project which I implemented for EECS 495 Deep Learning from Scratch

In this project, I applied deep learning knowledge to computer vision area; I used the open source software library, TensorFlow, for my numercial computation; and utilized MNIST which is a simple computer vision dataset consisting of images of handwritten digits. The purpose of the project is to train a model to look at images and predict what digits they are.

Bascially, I grasped the idea of building model from https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/beginners. After building the sample model and sophisticated model along with the guideline, I got familiar with TensorFlow programming and also obtained a deeper understanding towards Convolutional Neural Network(CNN).
